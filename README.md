<h1>I have created this React app to organize my Quran translation.</h1>

<h2>Initial Plans</h3>

<ol>
<li>Using the Quran.com API to load the chapters and verse form the Quran</li>
<li>Using the Quran.com API to load some translations of the verses</li>
<li>Under each verse, keep an input field for my own Bengali translation</li>
<li>Better design and other features will be added eventually</li>
</ol>
